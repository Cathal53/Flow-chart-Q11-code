# Flow-chart-Q11-code
This program continuously monitors the state of two input pins (p13 and p16) and controls two output pins (p23 and p25) based on the input states. The logic directly follows the flowchart provided, ensuring that the correct LEDs (or other devices) are turned on or off based on button presses.
